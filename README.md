The TIAGo Chef Assistant project explores the integration of human-robot interaction
(HRI) and reliable robot behavior control (RBC) to create a simulated domestic assistant that can
perceive objects and ingredients, converse with a human operator, propose context-aware recipes,
and physically manipulate small kitchen items.
